# Project Overview:



This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for PowerCo, a utility company, to understand the reasons behind customer turnover and predict future churn. This analysis is crucial for identifying key customer segments at risk and implementing strategies to improve retention. The project showcases advanced data analytics skills, effective data visualization, and predictive modeling to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.





# Objectives



Data Exploration: Analyze the customer data to identify key characteristics and patterns associated with churn.
Data Analysis: Utilize Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to conduct in-depth data analysis.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to interpret trends and insights from the data.
Predictive Modeling: Engineer and optimize a random forest model to predict customer churn with high accuracy.
Executive Summary: Provide a concise summary with actionable insights for the Associate Director to facilitate informed decision-making.
Tools and Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Employed for numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Utilized for data visualization to uncover insights and trends.
Scikit-Learn: Used for building and optimizing the random forest model.
Project Workflow



# Data Collection and Cleaning:

Imported and cleaned customer data to ensure it was ready for analysis.
Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and performed necessary preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the data distribution, detect patterns, and identify correlations between features.
Visualized key metrics and trends to uncover insights related to customer churn.
Feature Engineering:

Engineered new features from the existing data to improve model performance.
Selected the most relevant features based on their correlation with customer churn.
Model Building:

Built a random forest model for predicting customer churn.
Optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning to achieve a high accuracy rate of 91%.
Evaluation:


Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compared the model with baseline and other potential models to validate its effectiveness.
Visualization and Reporting:


Created visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.
Compiled an executive summary highlighting the key insights and recommendations based on the analysis.



# Results
The random forest model achieved an accuracy rate of 91% in predicting customer churn.
Identified critical factors influencing churn, such as customer tenure, usage patterns, and service satisfaction.
Provided actionable insights for PowerCo to target high-risk customer segments and implement retention strategies.



# Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the use of advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze customer churn. By understanding the key drivers of churn and leveraging predictive modeling, PowerCo can make data-driven decisions to reduce customer turnover and enhance customer satisfaction.
