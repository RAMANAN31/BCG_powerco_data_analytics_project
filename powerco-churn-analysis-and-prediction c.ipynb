{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Power Co  Churn Analysis\n","\n","  Powerco is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies corporate, SME (Small & Medium enterprises), and residential customers. The power liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.\n","\n","  A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good **predictive model** could be useful.\n","  \n","## Hypothesis Framing\n","\n","* **Null Hypothesis** : The change in customer price affects customer churn.\n","* **Alternative Hypothesis** : The change in customer price does not affect customer churn.\n","\n","## Understanding PowerCo Pricing\n","\n","The PowerCo company comes under the category of the utility industry. Generally, Utility Industry follows a dynamic pricing method to charge their service. **Dynamic Pricing** or surge pricing is a pricing strategy in which businesses set flexible prices for products or services based on current market demands. There were several existing algorithms to calculate the price dynamically.\n","\n","## Electricity Pricing\n","\n","**Fixed Charges:**\n","These charges are electricity costs that don’t change no matter how much electricity you use. Fixed charges are designed to recover the basic cost of electric service. The fixed demand charges can be charged as per the use of utility service in the area and can result in higher charges due to the higher use of the utility.\n","\n","**Peak Pricing or Tariff Pricing:** \n","Such a type of tariff is similar to peak load tariffs. The only difference is that the seasonal tariff measures the peak hour of the year and the peak tariff calculates it for the day.  If the power consumption is high, then it is known as the on-peak tariff, and for low power consumption, it is called the off-peak load tariff.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-26T13:27:02.34215Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-26T13:27:02.341051Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-26T13:27:02.990066Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-26T13:27:02.988906Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-26T13:27:02.342091Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import
